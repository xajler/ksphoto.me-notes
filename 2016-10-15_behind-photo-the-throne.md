## Description

I first time used _Formatt-Hitech ND 3.0_ for B&W (should not be used for colour photography).
First long exposure, that I didn't much like at the end, it didn't include island in background, and it was at different angle.

> first long exposure

Missed some more sun (maybe better) because I was interrupted by seagull who liked to pose.

First metering was around 2:40 mins which is a 4:00 min shutter with reciprocity failure applied for _Fuji Neopan Acros 100_. Since sun was descending, I've used 4:00 min shutter (6:00 min with reciprocity failure).

Final exposure was: 
Aperture: f/11 
Shutter speed: 6:00 min with reciprocity failure.

## Digital processing 

* Vignetting. 
* Sharpening (flatbed scanner is usually flat). 
* A bit crop for straighten the horizon (not sure what was wrong with me to miss that much horizon). 
* Few distraction rocks cloned and removed.

## Lessons learned

* Do not use locking shutter release with Mamiya RZ67. 
* Pay more attention to horizon.
