# FP4+: Rijeka, Factory and Piano

> Contact Sheet photo

**Camera**: Mamiya RZ 67

**Film**: Ilford FP4+

On Saturday I went for a photo shoot, not really best weather. I’ve got very late, at least for _Ilford FP4+_ at box speed 125.

First 4 shots I’ve taken with same subject: beautiful _Ploech Palace_ in _Rijeka_. Maybe this palace should be taken it colour, but I tried to do it in black and white. But this was not really best time to shoot it in black and white. Did take with _Yellow #8_ and _Orange #21_ filter, but neither looks promising.

After some walk and wondering what too shout, found a scene in one factory in _Rijeka_, it was getting late and my exposure with _Yellow #8_ filter plus Reciprocity Failure was around 51 sec, I’ve round it on 1 min. 1 min is actual B on _Mamiya RZ67_ max, so I have it shutter release cable pressed until Mamiya closed shutter at 1 min.

I’ve mostly have problems with _Mamiya RZ67_ and changing lenses and then I sometimes forget to change aperture or shutter speed after metering.

This time I forgot to change shutter speed, so I have one blank photo in this roll.

It was too dark, after this shoot, so I decide to do something in doors. My first idea was to try _Mamiya RZ67_ with flash, but after realising this will not be easy as I thought it would be, I’ve played with cheap video light and piano.

I’ve used 250mm, pretty close, 2m from subject (+ 1 stop for 250mm), with _Yellow #8_ filter. Did two similar scenes.

Afterwards did same scenes with 180mm,  1.5m from subject (+0.5 stop for 180mm). Problem was I metered for f/11, but again forgot to change it on lens. It stuck for some reason at f/6.7, 1.5 stop difference from f/11. I did two similar scenes and for both, I had wrong aperture. At least it wasn’t that much of difference, so photos are kind of ok.
