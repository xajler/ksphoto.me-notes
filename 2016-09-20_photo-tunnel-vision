## Description

I wrongly calculated (1+9) it should have been 50ml of _Adotech III_, and I’ve been using _25ml_ which is _(1+19)_, all in all it looks ok, for _ISO 20_, two others _CMS 20_ at _ISO 12_, were lacking a lot of contrast. Film had lots of spots black and white, and lots of little scratches digitally removed.
