# Long Exposure on Film: #1 Intro

I've always liked long exposures and when I've started with film nearly year ago, it was so much going on, from me learning everything from using spot meter to trying some developers and doing my own black and white development.
I've developed nearly 80 rolls of film this first year in analogue, and got it as a second nature.

My main problem is that I have no vision what to shoot, I think I have reasonably good portfolio for only one year in film photography [ksphoto.me](http://ksphoto.me). But I want to explore more some edge cases of film, and long exposures are kind of those. 

Long exposures are completely unpredictable, and it can have quite a effect and get you some interesting photos. By mixing in this film with its grain and reciprocity failure (driven by Schwarzschild law) I think film can give some more uniqueness with using long exposures. I think film photographers like Michael Kenna and Hiroshi Sugimoto gave an interesting look to film, even inspired lots of digital photographers.

## Objectives

This whole idea was to do some experimentation with long exposures. For easiness I've used 35mm, just for having 37 shots with it, but this also proven tiresome, taking 2 rolls of film in two days 70+ photos as long exposures it is lots of time just waiting for shot to finish. This is why I didn't go in more extremly long exposures, I'll leave those for next level and medium format.

There is also one objective that I wanted to test, and this is different reciprocity failures, and there are two for Ilford HP5+ official and G. Gainer version. There will be more details on this in next parts.

## Gear

* Nikon D610 (Digital, set to monochrome mode, used to get wanted exposure and good for feedback/comparison with developed photos)
* Nikon F100 (Analogue, not best choice because of battery, but I could use same lens with D610)
* Samyang 85mm f1.4 (Manual vidio lens, used in most of shots)
* Samyang 24mm f1.4 (Manual vidio lens, used in few shots)
* 2x Ilford HP5+ 400 at 800 ISO
* 2x Lee Filters holders (one with universal lens hood) with 72mm and 77mm adapters for these two lenses
* Welding protective glass rated as shade 12 (15.6 stops of light)
* Formatt-Hitach 3.0 ND (10 stops, only for black and white, not for color)
* Lee Filters 0.6 ND (2 stops)
* Formatt-Hitech #25 Red filter
* Formatt-Hitech #8 Yellow filter
* Meike Remote Shutter release for Nikon F100
* Few iPhone apps deserving new blog post.

# Filters and holders

This part is more DIY, since Shade 12 welding glass or Format-Hitech ND 3.0 are not seald to holders there is need to do it yourself. If not there will be gigantic light leeks, mostly in middle of photo. I use black electrical tape or it might be called duct tape, but it must not be with holes, so that can block the light.
Usually ND 3.0 should have this done better Lee Filters Big Stopper and Haida filters have this covered, but this low priced 3.0 ND and Shade 12 welding glass don't have it, so I need to do DIY protection of the light. And to clarify this is only needed when using this on daylight, especially bright daylight. There shouldn't have been any light leeks when shooting at night and dim places, I didn't try it but I assume.



## Workflow 1

1. Get photo and metering with digital camera.
2. Get same photo with analog, as a base exposure.
3. Add filter either -15.5/-16 with Shade 12 or -10 to -13 with ND 3.0 with mix of #25, #8 and 0.6 ND.
4. Calculate exposure for given filter.
5. Add official or G. Gainer reciprocity failure (RF)
6. Shoot both photos official and G. Gainer RF.

# Worflow 2

Few last photos taken inside with even light to even more test official vs. G. Gainer RF.

1. Get photo and metering with digital camera.
2. Get same photo with analog, as a base exposure.
3. Use 3.0 ND as filter
4. Do two double photos for offical and G. Gainer RF, one was extreme for offical 45:00 mins.


## Observations

It is very tedious/boring to shoot lots of long exposures. I should have do it in more than two days:

* 1st day: 24 exposures (few misfired and battery dead).
* 2nd day: 48 exposures (even more misfired, 4 done at home).


For what I kind of feel I was looking, 35mm was to panoramic for my taste. I think square 6x6 or 6x7 on my Mamiya RZ67 should be better.
Nikon F100 is not really suitable for this, because of battery and me forgetting switching it off.
Mamiya RZ67 with its Bulb up to 1 min and T on the lens for long exposure (and no battery involved) is much better design.
This was all experimental and Nikon F100 is used just because I can use D610 and share lenses. 


## Next 

### Film development

Now there is need to develop those two HP5+ films. Since I don't have enlarger it will be digitally scanned. 
After some thoughts and consideration, to develop this two rolls of film I'll use Ilford ID-11 in Ilford recommended time for ISO 800, other developer I was considering is Ilford Microphen, but I'll leave it for some serious work and medium format. Fixer and Stop bath will be both by Ilford, where fixer is Rapid Fixer, dilluted in noraml Ilford recommended dillution.


### Film scanning

And since Canon CanoScan 9000F is not that much of a scanner (especially for 35mm on pushed film), I'll do both my own and pay for local photo lab to scan it to, not sure what they have for settings, but just to see difference.

### Next part

In next part after development and scanning, I'll go throgh some images with obeservations and most interested in RF between official and G.Gainer.
I have in mind to have all this to include all this photos for comparing, probably not in this order:

1. B&W Digital photo (normal exposure)
2. Colour Digital photo (normal exposure)
3. Film photo (normal exposure, my scan)
4. Film photo (normal exposure, lab scan)
5. Film photo (official RF long exposure, my scan)
6. Film photo (official RF long exposure, lab scan)
7. Film photo (G.Gainer RF long exposure, my scan)
8. Film photo (G.Gainer RF long exposure, lab scan)

I'll do no editing on photos, except scanned and lab scanned, not sure how they work, at least VueScan, it is doing some kind of exposure, but if use None, then it is completely muted.
